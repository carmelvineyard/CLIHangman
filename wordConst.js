/*Pseudocode:

code goes here that picks a word from an array.

require = choicesConst.js

choicesConst.js has the array and the mechanism for choosing a word.

It then makes an object, perhaps something like:

var correctObject = 
{position0: h,
position1: o,
position2: u,
position3: s,
position4: e
}

probably by looping through the correctLetters array.

module.export to letterConst.js and hangmanCLI.js?
